                            <strong>THE ASSESSMENT WE NEED TO DO BEFORE GIVING YOU CREDIT</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            Before we provide credit to you, we assess whether the credit is suitable for you. To do this, we need to;
                            <br><br>
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>make reasonable inquiries about your requirements and objectives;</li>
                            <li>make reasonable inquiries about your financial situation;</li>
                            <li>take reasonable steps to verify your financial situation and that the credit or increase will meet your requirements and objectives;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        We won’t be able to give you credit if our assessment shows that:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The credit will not meet your requirements or objectives or</li>
                            <li>    you were in default under another small amount credit contract or</li>
                            <li>    in the past 90 days, you have two or more small amount credit contracts or.</li>
                            <li>    you won’t be able to meet the proposed repayments without substantial hardship;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        If you enter a loan contract with us, you can ask us for a copy of our loan assessment any time up to 7 years. If you make a request within 2 years of entering the loan contract, the copy of our loan assessment will be provided within 7 business days of your request.
