                            <br><br>
                            Our website also contains links to the websites of third party providers of goods and services (Third Party websites). If you have accessed Third Party websites through our website and if those third parties collect information about you, we may also collect or have access to that information as part of our arrangements with those third parties.
                            <br><br>
                            Where you access a Third Party website from our website, cookie information, information about your preferences or other information you have provided about yourself may be shared between us and the third party.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Advertising and tracking</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            When you view our advertisements on a Third Party website, the advertising company uses 'cookies' and in some cases 'web beacons' to collect information such as:
                            <br><br>
                        </p><ul>

                            <li>    the date and time of your visit; and</li>
                            <li>    the performance of their marketing efforts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        When you access our website after viewing one of our advertisements on a Third Party website, the advertising company collects information on how you utilise our website (e.g. which pages you view) and whether you complete an online application.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Cookies</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        We use ‘cookies’ to provide you with better and more customised service and with a more effective website.
                        <br><br>
                        A ‘cookie’ is a small text file placed on your computer by our web page server. A cookie can later be retrieved by our webpage servers. Cookies are frequently used on websites and you can choose if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring your preferences and options in your internet browser.
                        <br><br>
                        We use cookies for different purposes such as:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>to allocate a unique number to your internet browsers;</li>

                            <li>    to identify if you have accessed a Third Party Website; and</li>
                            <li>    for security purposes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>IP addresses</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Your IP address is the identifier for your computer when you are using the internet.
                        <br><br>
                        It may be necessary for us to collect your IP address for your interaction with various parts of our website.

                        Online applications.
                        <br><br>
                        When you send a completed online application to us, we retain the information contained in that application.  We are able to then use that information to provide any financial services that you require.
                        <br><br>
                        You can also suspend and save online applications, so you can complete and send the applications at a later time. If you suspend or save your application, the information that you have entered will be retained in our systems so that you may recover the information when you resume your application. Online applications that have been suspended or saved may be viewed by us.

                        <strong>Security of information</strong>

                        We regularly review developments in security and encryption technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as totally secure.
                        <br><br>
                        We take all reasonable steps to protect the information in our systems from misuse, interference, loss, and any authorized access, modification or disclosure.
                        <br><br>
                        If we no longer require your information, and we are legally permitted to, we will take all reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the information.
                        <br><br>
                        We take reasonable steps to preserve the security of cookie and personal information in accordance with this policy. If your browser is suitably configured, it will advise you whether the information you are sending us will be secure (encrypted) or not secure (unencrypted).
